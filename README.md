# Google Admob Implementation

1) Please add GoogleMobileAds Framework to your project, through pods or otherwise!
This is a quick process that can be completed with a quick google search - Google provides great documentation to get started!

2) This function adds banner ads to the bottom of your screen, no matter the scene being presented!

3) To disable, just create a function in your code to set UserDefaults  "noAds" = true

Happy Coding!
